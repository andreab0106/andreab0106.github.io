## Abstract

This research paper presents agricultural credit and its influence on the reduction of rural monetary poverty during two governments that are opposites in terms of economic policy. The first refers to the period of Alan Garcia's government (1985-1990), in which the State was able to intervene considerably in the rural financial system through the Agrarian Bank. Due to its poor management and its preferences for certain types of farmers, this bank accentuated inequality and with it rural monetary poverty. The second refers to the regime of Alberto Fujimori (1990-2000), in which the agrarian sector lost prominence in the government's priorities, and financial liberalization was an economic measure that was detrimental to the development of the agricultural sector.

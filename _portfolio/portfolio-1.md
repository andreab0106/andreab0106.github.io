In this section you will find a [repository](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-)of the Applied Statistics course I took as an undergraduate at PUCP. The course was taught to provide us with the necessary tools for all those who are starting in Machine Learning.

Below I will detail in a summarized way what you will find in each folder of the repository. 

## 1. [Introduction to Causal Inference](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Causal%20Inference)

## 2. [Partiallinng-Out using Lasso](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/2.%20Partialling-Out%20using%20lasso)

## 3. [RCT data with Precision Adjusment](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/3.%20RCT%20data%20with%20Precision%20Adjustment)

## 4. [Orthogonal Learning and Double Lasso](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/4.%20Orthogonal%20Learning%20and%20Double%20Lasso)

## 5. [Bootstraping and Causal Tree](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/5.%20Bootstraping%20and%20Causal%20Tree)

## 6. [Causal Forest and Debiased Machine Learning](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/6.%20Causal%20Forest%20and%20Debiased%20Machine%20Learning)


### Note: El presente repositorio fue creado por mi persona. Sin embargo, los c√≥digos replicados tanto en R como en Python se trabajaron de manera grupal junto a [Sandra Martinez](https://sandramartinezgutierrez.github.io/) y [Gianfranco Soria](https://gianfrancosoria.github.io//).

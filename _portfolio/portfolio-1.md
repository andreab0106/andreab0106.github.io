In this section you will find a [repository](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-)of the Applied Statistics course I took as an undergraduate at PUCP. The course was taught to provide us with the necessary tools for all those who are starting in Machine Learning.

Below I will detail in a summarized way what you will find in each folder of the repository. 

## 1. [Introduction to Causal Inference](https://github.com/andreab0106/Causal-Inference-and-Machine-Learning-Course-/tree/main/1.%20Introduction%20to%20Causal%20Inference)

### Important Note: This repository was created by myself. However, the replicated codes in both R and Python were worked on as a group together with [Sandra Martinez](https://sandramartinezgutierrez.github.io/) and [Gianfranco Soria](https://gianfrancosoria.github.io//).

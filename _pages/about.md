## About me 

I am an 8th cycle student of the Faculty of Social Sciences, majoring in Economics, with special interest in applied econometrics and academic research on issues related to economic and social development (microfinance, poverty, gender perspective, among others). In the same line, I have a special interest in issues related to the labor market (informality and discrimination). I am currently working as a research assistant in the [Department of Economics](https://departamento.pucp.edu.pe/economia/), PUCP and I am Subirector General of the [Economica Organization](https://economica.pe/), PUCP.
